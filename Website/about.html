    <p class="about_p"><b>Hello,</b> my name is Aditya Arora. Currently, I am in my second year pursuing a double major in Mathematics & CCIT at the University of Toronto. Ever since the age of 12, I've had a passion for mathematics and computer programming, which influenced my decision on the majors I am currently pursuing. I've always wanted to become a Data Scientist as I enjoy programming and working with mathematical data. As for hobbies, I am an automotive enthusiast and I enjoy playing video games during my free time. Some sports I play are soccer, basketball, table tennis and badminton. I also have experience with Karate! If you would like to know more about the projects that I have done in the past, please click <a class="about_a" href="portfolio.html">here.</a></p>
